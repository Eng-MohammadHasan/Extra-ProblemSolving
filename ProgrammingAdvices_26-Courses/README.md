# ðŸ“˜ ProgrammingAdvices â€“ 26 Courses (Reference)

This folder serves as a reference to my work based on the **ProgrammingAdvices 26-Courses Roadmap**, a structured series that covers topics like C++, algorithms, data structures, and full-stack development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Exists

While most of my problem-solving is organized by platform (like Codeforces or LeetCode),  
this roadmap is another valuable source that I actively use to strengthen my understanding and practice problem-solving in a structured way.

> This folder exists to acknowledge that I'm solving problems from **multiple learning sources**, not just online judges.
